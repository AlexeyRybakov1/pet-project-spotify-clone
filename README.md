**This is my first pet-project**

This is my first project that I made using a guide on YouTube. I wanted to learn Next 13.4, React, Stripe, Supabase, PostgreSQL, Tailwind, so I chose the Spotify clone. Of course I tried to understand every line and not just copy everything from the video. I could copy everything from Github. But my goal was not to make a clone, but to learn how to write using the above technologies.

The site is available at the link - https://sheihtify.vercel.app/
On it you can add music that will be added to the database.
Also like your favorite songs.
And of course, subscribe. For this I used strip test mode. Therefore, you can simply enter “4242...” everywhere in order to subscribe for free
